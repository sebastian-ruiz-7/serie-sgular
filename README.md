# This is a tech test for frontEnd developer position for sngular

The test consist in the next instruccions

Develop a class with a method that returns the nth term of the series:
serie(n)= fibonacci(n) -2triangular(n) + primo(n)


Perform unit tests using the 10 natural numbers as input (10 test cases in total).

Develop 3 React components:
1.- a visual component that shows a form to enter the number n
2.- a non-visual component where the nth term of the series is calculated
3.- a visual component that shows the result of the calculation

They are expected to be separate components to evaluate the passage of information between components.
